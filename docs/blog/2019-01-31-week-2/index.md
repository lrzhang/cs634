This is a short list of things to pay attention to after Lecture #1. Since the 1st lecture was an overview of the field of study including the state of ML/AI today and where thins are going there is not much technical content. Having use the time after  the 1st lecture to:

1. Download the two textbooks so that you can consult them during the lectures. 
2. Purchase the book by Geron if you can or reserve it from the library. The 3rd book is relatively inexpensive and very useful to your study.
3. Show up with your laptop during the lectures as this course will take an applied ML form where you are expected to be able to program in Python and set up the ML development environment in your own laoptop. 
4. Get gihub and kaggle accounts. For most of these services you can use your google account to login. 
5. Clone or Fork the book's code from https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml
6. Understand the concept of the pipeline so that you are able to map the concepts to the right pipeline. For example, feature engineering is part of the data pipeline, when we talk about stochastic gradient descent optimization, this can be used on the data pipeline as well as in the training pipeline. 
7. Understand the concept of inference and the mapping to the serving pipeline. Geron's chapter 1 also discusses pipelines.
